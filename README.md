# 🌱 Plant Growth Analysis – Mini Project Report

## 1. Introduction

Plant growth analysis plays an important role in modern agriculture and smart farming. With the help of Machine Learning and Computer Vision, it is possible to analyze plant conditions, predict growth patterns, and visualize results in an effective way. This mini project demonstrates how advanced technologies like **YOLO**, **Machine Learning models**, **Groq**, and **Streamlit** can be integrated into a single system for plant growth analysis.
